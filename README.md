WordPress is awesome, it's super easy to host with a one click install, so you can be up and running in minutes. These low barriers to entry along with its popularity make WordPress susceptible to mistakes and mischief.

To secure your WordPress site, there are a plethora of solutions to choose from, but knowing which ones to use, how it should be configured and who should do this work is complicated.

Through collating and sharing links and resources, we aim to improve WordPress Application Security for WordPress CMS admins.
